#These two parts are all you need

#The first the client goes on every machine that needs access to the /shared directory
fsclient:

    - fsserver:server

# The second the server should only go on one machine.
# It makes sense to back up this directory regularly!

fsserver:

  volumes:
    - /var/rsync-server:/shared:rw


#Then any container which wants to make use of the /shared directory just uses the volumes_from: as shown in the examples below

# This part is just to show you it working
test:

    - fsclient
